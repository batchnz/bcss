**bcss is a design-agnostic front-end framework for building both small and large websites. It is powered by Sass and references the ideas and methodologies of BEM, OOCSS and ITCSS.**

While not technically a fork of [inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss), bcss might well as be. It is heavily influenced by the work of [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/), [his blog](https://csswizardry.com/archive/) and inuitcss. While the two projects are very similar our desire to build upon Harry's originals ideas and explore new possibilities led us to create and maintain our own framework.
