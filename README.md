**bcss is a front-end framework for building both small and large websites. It is powered by Sass and references the ideas and methodologies of BEM, OOCSS and ITCSS.**

While not technically a fork of [inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss), bcss might well as be. It is heavily influenced by the work of Harry Roberts, inuitcss and [his blog](https://csswizardry.com/). The two projects are very similar but our desire to build upon Harry's originals ideas and progress in other directions led us to create and maintain our framework.
